= Actualizando LabvCNC

== Actualizando de 2.4.x a 2.5.x

As of version 2.5.0, the name of the project has changed from LBV2
to LabvCNC. All programs with "lbv" in the name have been changed to
"labvcnc" instead. All documentation has been updated.

Additionally, the name of the debian package containing the software
has changed. Unfortunately this breaks automatic upgrades. To upgrade
from lbv2 2.4.X to labvcnc 2.5.X, do the following:

=== On Ubuntu Lucid 10.04

First you need to tell your computer where to find the new LabvCNC
software:

* Click on the System menu in the top panel and select
  Administration->Software Sources.

* Select the Other Software tab.

* Select the entry that says

    http://labvcnc.org/lucid lucid base lbv2.4

    or

    http://labvcnc.org/lucid lucid base lbv2.4-sim

    and click the Edit button.

* In the Components field, change `lbv2.4` to `labvcnc2.5`, or change
  `lbv2.4-sim` to `labvcnc2.5-sim`.

* Click the OK button.

* Back in the Software Sources window, Other Software tab, click the
  Close button.

* It will pop up a window informing you that the information about
  available software is out-of-date. Click the Reload button.

Now your computer knows about the new software, next we need to tell
it to install it:

* Click on the System menu in the top panel and select
  Administration->Synaptic Package Manager

* In the Quick Search bar at the top, type `labvcnc`.

* Click the check box to mark the new labvcnc package for installation.

* Click the Apply button, and let your computer install the new
  package. The old lbv 2.4 package will be automatically removed to make
  room for the new LabvCNC 2.5 package.

=== On Ubuntu Hardy 8.04

First you need to tell your computer where to find the new LabvCNC software:

* Click on the System menu in the top panel and select Administration->Synaptic Package Manager

* Go to Settings->Repositories.

* Select the "Third-Party Software" tab.

* Select the entry that says

    http://labvcnc.org/hardy hard lbv2.4

    or

    http://labvcnc.org/hardy hardy lbv2.4-sim

    and click the Edit button.

* In the Components field, change `lbv2.4` to `labvcnc2.5` or `lbv2.4-sim` to `labvcnc2.5-sim`.

* Click the OK button.

* Back in the Software Sources window, click the Close button.

* Back in the Synaptic Package Manager window, click the Reload button.


Now your computer knows about the new software, next we need to tell it to install it:

* In the Synaptic Package Manager, click the Search button.

* In the Find dialog window that pops up, type `labvcnc` and click the
  Search button.

* Click the check-box to mark the labvcnc package for installation.

* Click the Apply button, and let your computer install the new
  package. The old lbv 2.4 package will be automatically removed to make
  room for the new LabvCNC 2.5 package.

== Config changes

The user configs moved from $HOME/lbv2 to $HOME/labvcnc, so you will
need to rename your directory, or move your files to the new place.

The hostmot2 watchdog in LabvCNC 2.5 does not start running until the
HAL threads start running. This means it now tolerates a timeout on the
order of the servo thread period, instead of requiring a timeout that's
on the order of the time between loading the driver and starting the HAL
threads. This typically means a few milliseconds (a few times the servo
thread period) instead of many hundreds of milliseconds. The default
has been lowered from 1 second to 5 milliseconds. You generally don't
need to set the hm2 watchdog timeout any more, unless you've changed
your servo thread period.

The old driver for the Mesa 5i20, hal_m5i20, has been removed after being
deprecated in favor of hostmot2 since early 2009 (version 2.3.) If you
are still using this driver, you will need to build a new configuration
using the hostmot2 driver. Pncconf may help you do this, and we have
some sample configs (hm2-servo and hm2-stepper) that act as examples.
