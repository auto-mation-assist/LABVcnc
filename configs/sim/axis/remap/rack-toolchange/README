This example of a racktoolchanger attempts a transliteration of micges racktoolchanger patch.

This assumes tool number == pocket number; the pocket number in the tool.tbl is currently ignored.

See http://wiki.labvcnc.org/cgi-bin/lbvinfo.pl?RackToolChanger .

NB:

I dont fully understand the meanings of the pins involved, and the dwell and moves.  This has NOT been tested on a real machine. Use as starting point for your own experimentation.
