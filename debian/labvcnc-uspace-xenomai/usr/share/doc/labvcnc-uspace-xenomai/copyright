Comment: 
 Much of LabvCNC is derived from LBV1, a work of Fred Proctor, Tom Kramer,
 Will Shackleford, and others.  That work was originally released into
 the public domain.  It was used as the basis of LabvCNC, but received
 extensive modifications.  LabvCNC is NOT public domain.  Anyone wishing
 to use the public domain code in a way that is not compatible with the
 (L)GPL must locate the original LBV1 code - they may NOT use LabvCNC.
